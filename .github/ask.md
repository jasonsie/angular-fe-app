# OOP Concept Analysis Template

## Dynamic Query Template

For what kinds of issues does the OOP concept - **"{concept}"** in {file_reference} try to solve? Please provide solid issues that the concept exists for, a brief summary, and a real scenario.

---

## Example Usage

```markdown
For what kinds of issues does the OOP concept - "single responsibility" in #file:10_Single_Responsibility.md try to solve? Please give me keywords, a brief summary and also a real scenario.
```

---

## Template Variables

- `{concept}`: The OOP concept name (e.g., "single responsibility", "open/closed principle", "dependency inversion")
- `{file_reference}`: The file reference (e.g., "#file:10_Single_Responsibility.md", "#file:11_Open_Closed.md")

---

## Standard Analysis Format

### Keywords
- [Dynamic based on concept]

### Brief Summary
[Explanation of what problems the concept solves]

### Real Scenario
[Practical example of how the concept applies in real-world development]

## Response Template

When analyzing any OOP concept, structure your response as follows:

### üîë Keywords
- [List 5-7 relevant keywords related to the problem domain]

### üìù Brief Summary
[2-3 sentences explaining what core problems this concept addresses]

### üèóÔ∏è Real Scenario
**Problem:** [Describe a common real-world development problem]

**Without the Concept:** [Explain what goes wrong without applying this principle]

**With the Concept:** [Show how applying the principle solves the problem]

**Benefits:** [List 3-4 concrete benefits gained]

## Advanced Usage

### Comparative Analysis
```
Compare how "single responsibility" in #file:10_Single_Responsibility.md and "open/closed principle" in #file:11_Open_Closed.md solve different aspects of code maintainability.
```

### Pattern Combinations
```
How do "factory pattern" in #file:factory_pattern.md and "dependency inversion" in #file:14_Dependency_Inversion.md work together to solve complex object creation issues?
```

### Anti-Pattern Analysis
```
What anti-patterns does "single responsibility" in #file:10_Single_Responsibility.md help prevent, and what are the warning signs of violating this principle?
```

## Notes for Contributors

1. **Variable Substitution**: Replace `{concept}` and `{file_reference}` with actual values
2. **Case Sensitivity**: Concept names should be lowercase with spaces
3. **File References**: Use the exact file path format shown in examples
4. **Analysis Depth**: Provide both theoretical understanding and practical application
5. **Real Scenarios**: Use concrete examples from web development, API design, or system architecture
