# Conventional Commits Guidelines

This project follows the [Conventional Commits 1.0.0 specification](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) to ensure consistent and meaningful commit messages that support automated tooling and clear communication.

## Commit Message Structure

```
<type>[optional scope]: <description>

[optional body]

[optional footer(s)]
```

## Required Components

### Type (Required)

The commit type **MUST** be one of the following:

-  **`feat`**: A new feature for the user (correlates with MINOR in SemVer)
-  **`fix`**: A bug fix for the user (correlates with PATCH in SemVer)
-  **`docs`**: Documentation changes only
-  **`style`**: Code style changes (formatting, missing semicolons, etc.)
-  **`refactor`**: Code refactoring without changing functionality
-  **`perf`**: Performance improvements
-  **`test`**: Adding or updating tests
-  **`build`**: Changes to build system or external dependencies
-  **`ci`**: Changes to CI/CD configuration files and scripts
-  **`chore`**: Other changes that don't modify src or test files
-  **`revert`**: Reverts a previous commit

### Description (Required)

-  **MUST** immediately follow the colon and space after the type/scope
-  Should be a short, imperative summary of the code changes
-  Use lowercase and no period at the end
-  Maximum 50 characters recommended

## Optional Components

### Scope (Optional)

-  **MAY** be provided after the type
-  **MUST** be a noun describing a section of the codebase
-  **MUST** be surrounded by parentheses
-  Examples: `feat(parser):`, `fix(auth):`, `docs(api):`

### Body (Optional)

-  **MAY** be provided after the description
-  **MUST** begin one blank line after the description
-  Can be multiple paragraphs separated by blank lines
-  Use to explain the motivation for the change and contrast with previous behavior

### Footer(s) (Optional)

-  **MAY** be provided one blank line after the body
-  Follow git trailer format
-  Use hyphens for multi-word tokens (e.g., `Reviewed-by:`)
-  Common footers: `Refs:`, `Closes:`, `Co-authored-by:`

## Breaking Changes

Breaking changes **MUST** be indicated in one of two ways:

1. **Footer approach**: Include `BREAKING CHANGE: <description>` in the footer
2. **Type prefix approach**: Append `!` after the type/scope (e.g., `feat!:`, `fix(api)!:`)

Breaking changes correlate with MAJOR version bumps in SemVer.

## Examples

### Basic Examples

```
feat: add user authentication
fix: resolve memory leak in data processing
docs: update API documentation
style: format code according to style guide
refactor: extract user service into separate module
```

### With Scope

```
feat(auth): implement OAuth2 integration
fix(parser): handle edge case in JSON parsing
docs(api): add endpoint documentation
test(utils): add unit tests for helper functions
```

### With Breaking Changes

```
feat!: redesign user authentication system

BREAKING CHANGE: The authentication API has been completely redesigned.
Users must now use OAuth2 instead of API keys.
```

### Complex Example

```
fix(api): prevent race condition in user requests

Introduce a request ID and reference to latest request. Dismiss
incoming responses other than from latest request.

Remove timeouts which were used to mitigate the racing issue but are
obsolete now.

Refs: #123
Closes: #456
```

### Revert Example

```
revert: let us never again speak of the noodle incident

Refs: 676104e, a215868
```

## Best Practices

1. **Use imperative mood**: "add feature" not "added feature"
2. **Be concise but descriptive**: Aim for clarity in the description
3. **Include context in body**: Explain the "why" not just the "what"
4. **Reference issues**: Use footers to link to issue numbers
5. **One logical change per commit**: Keep commits focused and atomic
6. **Consistent casing**: Use lowercase for types (recommended)

## Benefits

-  **Automated changelog generation**: Tools can parse commits to generate release notes
-  **Semantic versioning automation**: Automatically determine version bumps
-  **Clear communication**: Team members understand changes at a glance
-  **Better project history**: Structured commits make navigation easier
-  **Tool integration**: Enhanced compatibility with CI/CD and release tools

## Integration with Development Workflow

### Learning Environment Considerations

This repository serves as a learning environment for:

-  Data Structures and Algorithms
-  Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
-  Functional Programming (FP)
-  Design Patterns

When committing code related to these concepts, consider using descriptive scopes:

```
feat(data-structures): implement red-black tree
fix(algorithms): correct bubble sort edge case
docs(oop): add polymorphism examples
refactor(patterns): improve observer pattern implementation
test(fp): add unit tests for pure functions
```

### Scope Suggestions for This Project

-  `data-structures`: Arrays, trees, graphs, hash tables, etc.
-  `algorithms`: Sorting, searching, dynamic programming, etc.
-  `oop`: Classes, inheritance, polymorphism, encapsulation
-  `fp`: Pure functions, immutability, higher-order functions
-  `patterns`: Design patterns implementations
-  `examples`: Code examples and demonstrations
-  `docs`: Documentation and learning materials
-  `config`: Configuration files and environment setup

## Enforcement

This specification helps maintain code quality and project organization. While not every commit needs to be perfect, following these guidelines will:

-  Improve code review processes
-  Enable better tooling integration
-  Facilitate automated releases
-  Enhance project maintainability
-  Support learning objectives through clear change tracking

Remember: Conventional Commits encourage organized development practices that benefit both individual learning and collaborative work.
